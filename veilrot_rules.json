    "content": "Veilrot is a dark skirmish miniatures game set in a world unraveling at the seams—reshaped by the irradiant remnants of a shattered moon. When that celestial body fractured, it bled something divine and ruinous into the soil.<br><br>Now, reality itself is in flux. Fungal intelligences bloom beneath the surface, faith burns in silver fire, and ancient technologies twitch back to life. Nothing is stable. Nothing is safe. Nothing is sacred.<br><br>Players command warbands—small, elite groups of warriors, zealots, constructs, or aberrations—each shaped by their beliefs, biology, and battle doctrine. Some seek to restore what was lost, others to profit from the collapse, and still others to accelerate the transformation of the world into something wholly alien.<br><br>Gameplay in Veilrot focuses on tactical decision-making, resourceful positioning, and risk-driven combat. Every choice—whether movement, attack, or objective play—can swing the course of a game. There are no large armies here, only small forces with outsized impact, fighting over relics, memories, and fragments of power.<br><br>Factions are distinct in both theme and mechanics, but all warbands operate within the same brutal framework of conflict. Combat is fast and unforgiving. Objectives matter. Momentum shifts quickly. And the battlefield is never neutral—it twists and reacts with its own ancient hungers.<br><br>This document introduces the core mechanics that define how Veilrot is played. It covers everything from turn structure and actions to combat, objectives, and mission creation. Whether you come to burn, bind, or break the world, the first step is understanding its rules.",

        "title": "What You Need to Play",
        "content": "To play a game of Veilrot, each player will need to bring the tools of war, fate, and ruin. These essentials shape the battlefield and ensure smooth play:<br><br><ul><li><strong>A Warband:</strong> Each player commands a small group of unique miniatures, known as a warband. These may be custom-built or selected from pre-made rosters, and should include figure sheets, condition markers, and any relevant faction tokens or relic counters.</li><li><strong>Measuring Tools:</strong> Movement and range in Veilrot are measured in inches. A ruler or tape measure marked in inches is required for all gameplay.</li><li><strong>Six-sided Dice (D6):</strong> All rolls in Veilrot use standard six-sided dice. It's recommended that each player have a handful for attack rolls, saves, Grit checks, and other effects.</li><li><strong>Rulebook & Reference Sheets:</strong> Having the Veilrot Core Rules and faction-specific references on hand helps resolve abilities, conditions, and combat triggers without slowing the game.</li><li><strong>A Battlefield:</strong> Games of Veilrot are played on a richly textured battlefield, filled with ruins, fungal overgrowth, broken trenches, and unnatural terrain. The standard play area is 3 feet by 3 feet. Scenarios may adjust this size for narrative reasons. Objective markers—used to represent key control points or relics—should be included as part of the terrain setup.</li></ul><br>Creating an evocative battlefield enhances immersion and supports the game’s focus on movement, line of sight, and area control."

This stage defines the heart of the scenario—what must be claimed, protected, or destroyed to \nachieve victory. \nThe first part of this process is placing Objective Markers. \nPlace Objective Markers \nObjective markers represent relics, control points, corrupted growths, or sites of tactical value. These can \ninfluence the flow of battle dramatically, creating focal points that demand attention and draw blood. \nTo determine how many objective markers are placed and where they are located, roll 1D6 and consult the \nObjective Marker Table. This roll determines the type and layout of objectives for the scenario. Some \nresults may create a single focal point; others may scatter multiple smaller objectives across the board. \nThis method ensures that each game feels different, with terrain, deployment, and objectives combining in \nunique ways to shape the strategies both players will need to adopt. \n1.  \n \nWaning Path \n2.  \n \nBroken Front \n3.  \nStaggered Tide \n4.  \n \nTwilight Cross \n5.  \n \nVoid Compass \n6.  \n \nRifted Veil \nPrimary Objective \n \nSecondary Objective \nOnce you have your result, place the objective markers as described—usually at set distances from the center \nor corners of the board.

These objectives define how players earn points or claim victory \nand are influenced by the positioning of the markers already on the board.\n \n37"

Hold the Line — 3 Victory Point \n At the end of the game, at least half of your starting models must remain alive on the battlefield. \n Simple, but challenging in brutal scenarios. \n5. Oppressive Advance — 3 Victory Point \n At any point during the game, have at least one model contesting every Primary Objective. \n You don’t need to control them—just be within 1\". \n6.

First to Spill — 3 Victory Point \n Be the first player to destroy an enemy figure. \n If your opponent scores the first kill, this objective cannot be completed. \n5.

Now it only smolders and draws scavengers.\" \n Objectives are lunar core fragments and relic shards. The terrain becomes cratered, warped by \nmemory-heat and divine fallout. \nStep 1: Set Up the Battlefield \nThe players agree to use a 3' × 3' board. They populate it with ruins, fungal clusters, barricades, and \nelevation features, ensuring varied terrain that offers line of sight breaks, cover, and movement challenges. \nStep 2: Define Deployment Zones \nOne player rolls 1D6: the result is a 3. This means the game will be a “Pitched Skirmish” and both players \nuse the mirrored deployment zone. They roll another D6: the result is a 4: “Encroaching Tide” \ndeployment zone from the deployment zones table. Both players place their warbands in two rectangular \nboxes by their right table corner. \nStep 3: Determine the Mission Rules \nA player rolls 1D6 to determine the mission type. The result is a 5, which falls into the “Endure the Ruin” \ncategory (Hazard missions). \nThey roll another 1D6 to select a mission from that group: 4, resulting in the mission “Volatile Ground.” \nThey consult the mission sheet: \n● Primary Objectives score points as normal. \n \n● Secondary Objectives erupt when contested for the first time, causing damage. \n \n● The mission emphasizes movement and zone denial. \n \n \nStep 4: Place Objective Markers \nThe players roll 1D6 on the Objective Marker Layout Table and get a 2, resulting in the “Tri-Line” \nsetup—three objectives placed in a horizontal line across the center of the battlefield. \nTwo of these are designated as Primary, and one as Secondary, based on the mission instructions. \n56 \n \nStep 5: Determine Player Objectives \nEach player secretly rolls for a Player Objective. \n● Player A rolls 3 then 2, landing on “Zone Denial” from the Tactical table: Control three diﬀerent \nobjectives at the end of the game (2 VP). \n \n● Player B rolls 6 then 1, landing on “Wipe the Blade” from the Strike table: Destroy three enemy \nﬁgures over the course of the game (1 VP). \nThese are kept hidden until fulfilled or revealed at the end of the battle. \nThe mission is now fully formed. The players begin deploying their figures and preparing for the first round \nof battle. \n \n57"
