      "content": "Using a Narrative Layer <br>Before defining the mission and battlefield, players may choose to add a Narrative Layer to their battle. <br>This step is entirely optional and doesn't affect gameplay rules, but it provides rich flavor, deeper immersion, <br>and inspiration for terrain, model behavior, and storytelling. It can also help with visualizing and <br>encapsulating the setting around the conflict. <br>To generate one randomly: <br>1. Roll 1D6 to determine which category of battlefield you're fighting on. <br>D6 Roll <br>Narrative Layer Category <br>1–2 <br>Sacred & Profaned Sites <br>3–4 <br>Corruption & Collapse <br>5–6 <br>Industrial & Technolithic Wreckage <br>2. Then roll 1D6 again on the chosen table to determine the specific location and its flavor. <br>Alternatively, players can choose a narrative layer that suits their factions, models, or terrain setup. <br>Narrative Layers do not alter rules or objectives unless agreed upon by both players. They are purely <br>atmospheric—but often influence how players interpret events or roleplay their figures. <br> <br> <br> <br>52"

      "content": "Table A: Sacred & Profaned Sites <br>These are battlegrounds of belief—hallowed ruins, cursed shrines, and relic-laced soil that still echoes with faith, <br>fear, or fury. <br>1. Bloomheart Vault <br> Once a fungal reliquary. Now a breathing ruin. Primary Objectives are pulsing crypt-pods, sealed in <br>sporelight. Secondary markers are communion points or rotted altars. Everything here lives—some of it <br>doesn't want to. <br>2. Moonfall Shrine <br> An old site of devotion to the shattered moon, scattered with prayer-flags and charred votive pits. Objectives <br>are memory-altars. Every faction claims it once belonged to them. <br>3. Saint's Spinefield <br> A martyred body's vertebrae arches from the ground like a cathedral. Primary Objectives are bone-altars. <br>Secondary are nerve-beacons or organ shrines. Even the wind sounds like whispering prayers. <br>4. Ember Choir Ruins <br> Once a Moonfall chapel, now burned and hollow. Objectives lie among charred pillars and scorched censers. <br>Faith lingers in the ash—but so does something else. <br>5. Cracked Halo <br> A divine fragment impacted here generations ago. Lunar shards pulse underfoot. The battlefield is cratered <br>and humming. Objectives are still warm. <br>6. Vault of Vultures <br> An old archive-keep defiled by scavengers. Objectives are shattered data-vaults and bleeding obelisks. Rot <br>and reverence mix in the dust. <br> <br> <br> <br>53"

The Maw Beneath <br> Fissures in the ground vent Bloomlight and fungal spores. Objectives are rupture points. The land groans. <br>Sometimes, it answers. <br>2. The Sinking Front <br> Trenchworks drowned in rot and silence. Objectives lie half-submerged in waterlogged soil. Footing is <br>treacherous. So is memory. <br>3. Carrion Cradle <br> The corpse of a crashed relic-engine spills sanctified tissue into the ground. Primary Objectives are <br>graft-pods. The smell of sacred oil and wet iron never fades. <br>4. Everbled Crossing <br> A site soaked in centuries of blood. Nothing grows. Objectives are grave-posts and marrow shrines. Even the <br>rain feels hostile. <br>5. Mired Hollow <br> Once a fortified keep, now drowned in moss and regret. Objectives lie sunken and half-forgotten. The trees <br>hum with old warnings. <br>6. Pale Orchard <br> A twisted grove, blooming with impossible fruit. Objectives hang from crooked trees and fruit-stained <br>altars. Every root remembers joy—and mocks it. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>54"

Looters come <br>like flies. So do worse things. <br>2. Hollow Outpost Sigma <br> An Orrery telemetry tower flickers back to life. Objectives are signal pylons and power anchors. The <br>battlefield is shaped by fractured grids and angular ruin. <br>3. Lantern Verge <br> A border-watching outpost, once aglow with moonfire. Objectives are beacon towers and oathstones. Some <br>say relighting the lanterns will draw divine attention. Not all believe it's worth the risk. <br>4. Filament Spiral <br> Invisible strands of filament rise from beneath the dirt. Objectives are magnetic pylons and data-nodes. The <br>land sings in codes no one remembers how to read. <br>5. Throat of Echoes <br> A shattered canyon where sound fractures and dies. Objectives are resonant spires. Speech here is wrong. <br>Orders echo back rewritten. <br>6. Gloamfang Dredge <br> A dried-out fungal dredging field, abandoned after the Gloam Exodus. Objectives are dredge sieves and <br>rusted pumps. The air is dusty with rot. Nothing has grown right here since. <br> <br>55"

      "title": "Example: Generating a Mission",
      "content": "Example: Generating a Mission <br>To better understand how Veilrot battles are assembled, here's an example of how two players generate a full <br>mission using all the core setup steps. <br> <br>Step 1: Add a Narrative Layer (Optional) <br>To immerse the battlefield in Veilrot's world, the players choose to add a narrative flavor. <br>They roll 1D6 to determine the category: 2 → \"Sacred & Profaned Sites\" <br> Then they roll 1D6 again: 5, resulting in \"Cracked Halo\" <br>\"Once, something divine landed here. Now it only smolders and draws scavengers.\" <br> Objectives are lunar core fragments and relic shards. The terrain becomes cratered, warped by <br>memory-heat and divine fallout. <br>Step 1: Set Up the Battlefield <br>The players agree to use a 3' × 3' board. They populate it with ruins, fungal clusters, barricades, and <br>elevation features, ensuring varied terrain that offers line of sight breaks, cover, and movement challenges. <br>Step 2: Define Deployment Zones <br>One player rolls 1D6: the result is a 3. This means the game will be a \"Pitched Skirmish\" and both players <br>use the mirrored deployment zone. They roll another D6: the result is a 4: \"Encroaching Tide\" <br>deployment zone from the deployment zones table. Both players place their warbands in two rectangular <br>boxes by their right table corner. <br>Step 3: Determine the Mission Rules <br>A player rolls 1D6 to determine the mission type. The result is a 5, which falls into the \"Endure the Ruin\" <br>category (Hazard missions). <br>They roll another 1D6 to select a mission from that group: 4, resulting in the mission \"Volatile Ground.\" <br>They consult the mission sheet: <br>● Primary Objectives score points as normal. <br> <br>● Secondary Objectives erupt when contested for the first time, causing damage. <br> <br>● The mission emphasizes movement and zone denial. <br> <br> <br>Step 4: Place Objective Markers <br>The players roll 1D6 on the Objective Marker Layout Table and get a 2, resulting in the \"Tri-Line\" <br>setup—three objectives placed in a horizontal line across the center of the battlefield. <br>Two of these are designated as Primary, and one as Secondary, based on the mission instructions. <br>56 <br> <br>Step 5: Determine Player Objectives <br>Each player secretly rolls for a Player Objective. <br>● Player A rolls 3 then 2, landing on \"Zone Denial\" from the Tactical table: Control three different <br>objectives at the end of the game (2 VP). <br> <br>● Player B rolls 6 then 1, landing on \"Wipe the Blade\" from the Strike table: Destroy three enemy <br>figures over the course of the game (1 VP). <br>These are kept hidden until fulfilled or revealed at the end of the battle. <br>The mission is now fully formed. The players begin deploying their figures and preparing for the first round <br>of battle. <br> <br>57"
