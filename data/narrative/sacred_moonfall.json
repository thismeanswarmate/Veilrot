The shrine’s pillars are carved with lunar glyphs, their meanings lost to all but the most desperate. Pools of silver water collect in the hollows, disturbed only by the passage of those who dare to seek answers in the moon’s pale gaze.</p><br><p>The air is cool and sharp, tinged with the scent of night-blooming flowers and distant rain. Shadows move in ways that defy the sun, and every echo seems to come from somewhere else. The shrine is a place of questions, not answers, and those who linger too long find themselves changed by the moon’s silent pull.</p></div>"
