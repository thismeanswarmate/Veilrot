Prayer flags hang in tatters across scorched stone, and memory-altars rise from the ash like teeth in a forgotten mouth. Charred votive pits still breathe warmth, refusing to cool entirely, as if mourning something no one remembers clearly enough to name.</p><br><p>The wind moves differently here, tugging at incense smoke and broken prayer beads as though searching for voices long gone. Fragments of moonstone glitter underfoot, half-buried in cracked earth. Whispers cling to the shrine — soft, pleading, unfinished — echoing through the ruins with a weight that suggests they were never meant to stop.</p></div>"
