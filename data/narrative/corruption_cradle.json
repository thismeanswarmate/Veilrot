What was once a battlefield or a sacred grove now festers with creeping filth and seeping power. Roots twist in impossible angles, pulsing with foul luminance beneath layers of rot-choked earth. Cracked stones ooze black ichor, and every breath drawn in this place tastes of mildew, iron, and distant ruin.</p><br><p>The terrain reshapes itself with each visit â€” monuments lean where they once stood proud, and deep wells of essence bubble up in erratic convulsions. Whatever sanctity once lay here has been sundered, claimed by a hungering presence that coils just out of sight, whispering through the spores.</p></div>"
