Crypt-pods throb beneath layers of sporelight, their skins translucent and unwholesome. Communion points shimmer with bioluminescent intent, while altars weep rot into the soil. Nothing here is still. Nothing is dead. Not entirely.</p><br><p>The air pulses with organic rhythm, thick with drifting spores that coat lungs and thought alike. The vault exhales in waves, soft and slow, like some vast thing dreaming beneath the earth. Lights flicker from deep within the mycelial walls — not reflections, but eyes. The kind that open only when watched.</p></div>"
