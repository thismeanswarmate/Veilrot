The Throat of Echoes hums with relentless frequency — engines that never sleep, gears grinding against the silence. Control nodes blink behind armored grates, while conduits thrum beneath scarred walkways. Voices don’t travel normally here. They twist, bounce, and return changed. Some say the echoes speak truths not yet spoken.</p><br><p>Steam curls like breath from ruptured pipes, layering the battlefield in mist and acrid haze. The ground shivers with each mechanical pulse, a heartbeat too large to silence. Warnings are printed on rusted signage in languages no longer known. But the machines still understand. They remember the rhythm — and enforce it.</p></div>"
