Cracked stone altars cradle sacred flame that refuses to die, flickering with a hunger deeper than heat. Prayer circles are scorched into the earth, warped from centuries of invocation, while offering pits cough smoke in rhythmic bursts. Braziers burn with no fuel, fed instead by memory and sacrifice.</p><br><p>The scent of incense clings to every surface, masking the undercurrent of ash and charred bone. Light dances across shattered murals and fractured idols, making them seem to move when unobserved. Voices linger here — sung, whispered, or screamed — impossible to trace but too close to dismiss. The flames remember every hymn, and they burn for every silence since.</p></div>"
