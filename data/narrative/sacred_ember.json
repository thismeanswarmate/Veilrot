Ash drifts in slow spirals, settling on relics half-buried in the scorched earth. The air is thick with the scent of burnt offerings and the memory of prayers unanswered. Every surface is warm to the touch, as if the stones themselves remember the fires that once raged here.</p><br><p>Shadows flicker in the corners, cast by flames that no longer burn. The silence is broken only by the occasional crackle of embers, a reminder that the reliquary's heart still smolders, waiting for the faithful—or the foolish—to rekindle its ancient blaze.</p></div>"
