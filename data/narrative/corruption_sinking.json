    "content": "<div class='p-4'><p>Once a stable ridge, now a battlefield caught in slow collapse. The Sinking Front groans underfoot, its foundation riddled with corruption wells that bubble up through fractured earth. Each step risks plunging into waterlogged voids or cracking crusts that shift like breath. Monuments lean at eerie angles, and the essence that pools between them carries a sluggish, glowing rot.</p><br><p>The land here does not hold still. The terrain warps with the weight of unseen forces, and the very concept of footing becomes negotiable. Lights flicker in sinkhole depths â€” sometimes reflections, sometimes not. What falls here is rarely retrieved, and the longer one fights on this ground, the more it feels like the earth is choosing sides.</p></div>"
