Its trees twist skyward in gestures of mockery, their pale fruits swollen with pulsing corruption. Roots pierce old stone, curling around relics and choking the essence wells that once nurtured life here. The air is sweet and sour, like spoiled nectar, and everything feels just a little too still — as if the orchard is listening.</p><br><p>Fallen fruit clings to the soil like tumors, glowing faintly in the gloom. Branches rustle with no wind, stirred instead by voices that speak without mouths. Those who linger too long often hear their names carried in the leaf-song, and some say the orchard remembers each visitor — and decides who leaves.</p></div>"
