Relic chambers line the stonework like tombs of meaning, each sealed with rites too sacred to break and too dangerous to ignore. Guardian posts loom like sentinels long outlasted by their wardens, and offering altars bear the charred remnants of rituals whispered rather than spoken.</p><br><p>The air is unmoving, as if the vault itself holds its breath. Faint glows pulse from wards etched into the walls — old magic, still active, still watching. A hush lives here, broken only by the echo of distant prayers that never learned how to stop. The faithful left long ago. The power didn’t.</p></div>"
