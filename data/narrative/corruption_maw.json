Corruption pours from its vents in rhythmic pulses, tainting everything it touches. Pools of essence shimmer along the edges like bait, and shattered monuments cling to the rim like gravestones resisting the inevitable pull below.</p><br><p>The air is a chorus of tearing sounds, whispers laced with static, and the low groan of shifting stone. The tremors are constant. Something stirs in the dark beneath the surface, and each flicker of pale light from the depths suggests that it sees you — and it remembers the shape of things it wishes to swallow.</p></div>"
