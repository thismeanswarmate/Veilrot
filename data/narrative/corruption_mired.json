The swamp drinks light and reason alike, its surface veined with corrupted nexus points that throb beneath a sheen of stagnant water. Pools of essence lie still until disturbed, and the few shrines that remain sink deeper by the season, half-swallowed by the mireâ€™s restless hunger.</p><br><p>The air hangs heavy with the stink of old blood and wet bark. Every breath tastes of mold, and the ground clings with every step, as if reluctant to let go. In the distance, the gnarled silhouettes of trees twist in place, and somewhere deep in the fog, something whispers in a voice that sounds almost like your own.</p></div>"
