Footsteps vanish into mire that drinks deeper than it should, and every stone underfoot bears the stain of things lost. No shrine stands whole. No monument remains untouched. Primary objectives here are more than locations — they are lesions that pulse with vile purpose.</p><br><p>The air carries a wet heaviness, thick with the scent of iron and the sound of unseen things weeping in the fog. Mist clings to the skin and shifts with unnatural rhythm. The landscape itself resists silence; a quiet gurgle, a spatter, a heartbeat in the mud — reminders that this place is alive, and it remembers.</p></div>"
