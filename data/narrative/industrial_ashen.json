    "content": "<div class='p-4'><p>Stretched across a dead plain, the remnants of a mobile factory line lie choked in soot and silence. What was once a proud industrial caravan now sputters with failing lights and groaning machines that grind without purpose. Control nodes flicker behind rusted casings, and conduits crackle where the casing’s peeled back like old skin. A fine layer of ash settles over everything — a second skin on stone, steel, and bone alike.</p><br><p>The air hums with old electricity and unforgotten command lines. Smog hangs heavy, turning the sky a sickly gray, and the endless churn of engines echoes through hollow corridors. Somewhere deeper in the wreckage, a voice like static still calls orders no one obeys, and the ground itself feels warmed by the memory of purpose long since abandoned.</p></div>"
