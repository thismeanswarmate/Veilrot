Its glow cuts across rust-choked catwalks and shattered stations, casting long shadows that crawl like fingers. Power nodes surge and sputter beneath the ground, and what control remains flickers dimly behind reinforced glass. This place was once a border-watch, a sacred signal â€” now it only watches what should not be seen.</p><br><p>The hum of old machines never stops, echoing through cavernous chambers and along split conduits. Steam hisses from ruptured pipes, and the ground trembles with each pulse from the dying engines that refuse to fall silent. Beneath the light, nothing grows. But the dark between those beams? It listens.</p></div>"
