A ring of broken temples encircles a radiant void, where light wells still shimmer with celestial warmth. Sacred altars stand fractured but unextinguished, and prayer circles etched into the stone pulse faintly with power drawn from something both holy and wounded.</p><br><p>The air trembles with gentle radiance, thick with incense and quiet reverence. Every surface bears signs of forgotten rites â€” sacred symbols carved deep, worn smooth by time and supplication. A low, harmonic hum drifts through the ruins like a memory of chorus, soothing and unsettling in equal measure. The light never dies here, but it no longer heals without cost.</p></div>"
